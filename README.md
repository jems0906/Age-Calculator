The Age Calculator is a simple and user-friendly web application that allows users to determine their exact age in years and months based on their birth date. The project leverages modern JavaScript librariesâ€”Flatpickr for an intuitive date picker interface and Luxon for robust date and time calculations. Users simply select or enter their birth date, and upon submission, the application instantly displays their age, ensuring accurate results and handling invalid or future dates gracefully.
